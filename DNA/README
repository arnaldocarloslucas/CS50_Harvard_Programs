Program that identifies a person based on their DNA, as follows:

$ python dna.py databases/large.csv sequences/5.txt
Lavender

It sequences a DNA and identifies who it belongs to, through Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), which are short sequences of adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T)
ordered in a specific way. They can repeat during the DNA a few times, and this factor only happens repeatedly once in a quadrillion times in humans, so a number of repetitions 
of some variations of these genes, is an identity linked to a living being.

Use the files correctly and interact by discovering who owns the DNA of the Harry Potter characters!
