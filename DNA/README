Program that identifies a person based on their DNA, as follows:

$ python dna.py databases/large.csv sequences/5.txt
Lavender

It sequences a DNA and identifies who it belongs to, through Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), which are short sequences of adenine (A), 
cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T) ordered in a specific way. They can repeat during the DNA a few times, and this factor 
only happens repeatedly once in a quadrillion times in humans, so a number of repetitions of some variations of these genes, is 
an identity linked to a living being.

Use the files correctly and interact by discovering who owns the DNA of the Harry Potter characters!

The .txt files ranging from 1 to 4 are characters for the smaller list, and the .txt files ranging from 5 to 20 are compatible with 
the large list. The program also finds out if that DNA belongs to any person by saying, "No match".
