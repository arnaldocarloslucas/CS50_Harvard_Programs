# CS50_Harvard_Programs
All the work done during the course of introduction to computer science of the 
CS50 course at Harvardx as a method of approval and receipt of the certificate 
of completion of the same.

You can get the course on:

Some of the files needed to run some works belong to the course as well as their 
copyright, just the file I created that serves as my creation to complete the works.
